    "text": "Abstract\nRecent global warming is acting across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems to favor species adapted to warmer conditions and/or reduce the abundance of cold-adapted organisms (i.e., “thermophilization” of communities). Lack of community responses to increased temperature, however, has also been reported for several taxa and regions, suggesting that “climatic lags” may be frequent. Here we show that microclimatic effects brought about by forest canopy closure can buffer biotic responses to macroclimate warming, thus explaining an apparent climatic lag. Using data from 1,409 vegetation plots in European and North American temperate forests, each surveyed at least twice over an interval of 12–67 y, we document significant thermophilization of ground-layer plant communities. These changes reflect concurrent declines in species adapted to cooler conditions and increases in species adapted to warmer conditions. However, thermophilization, particularly the increase of warm-adapted species, is attenuated in forests whose canopies have become denser, probably reflecting cooler growing-season ground temperatures via increased shading. As standing stocks of trees have increased in many temperate forests in recent decades, local microclimatic effects may commonly be moderating the impacts of macroclimate warming on forest understories. Conversely, increases in harvesting woody biomass—e.g., for bioenergy—may open forest canopies and accelerate thermophilization of temperate forest biodiversity.\n\nPublication metrics"

Encontramos grandes diferencias en la producción anual de corcho tanto entre municipios como entre montes públicos y privados. Estas diferencias están determinadas, entre otros factores, por la superficie descorchada cada año y el grado de afectación por seca. En todos los casos estudiados existe una gran variabilidad interanual en la producción de corcho en la que intervienen factores ambientales, sociales y económicos. Además se detectan tendencias decrecientes de la producción durante estos 30 años en gran parte de los montes. Los resultados obtenidos aconsejan el seguimiento detallado del estado de los alcornocales a lo largo y ancho del Parque Natural para lograr la detección temprana de procesos de declive y la gestión adaptativa de la masa forestal ante los problemas derivados de la seca.\nWe have analysed cork production trends in six municipalities of Los Alcornocales Natural Park from 1985 to 2014, including data from public and private farms. We found large differences in annual cork production both between municipalities and between public and private forests. These differences are determined, among other factors, by the area uncorked each year and the degree of affectation by oak dieback. In all the cases studied there is great interannual variability in the production of cork in which environmental, social and economic factors intervene. In addition, we detected decreasing trends of cork production during these 30 years in most of the forests. These results call for the detailed monitoring of the state of cork oak forests across the Natural Park to achieve the early detection of oak decline and adaptive management in the face of dieback processes."

Here we present a compilation of all the symptoms and patients with primary CoQ deficiency described in the literature so far and analyse the most common clinical manifestations associated with pathogenic variants identified in the different COQ genes. In addition, we identified new associations between the age of onset of symptoms and different pathogenic variants, which could help to a better diagnosis and guided treatment.\nTo make these results useable for clinicians, we created an online platform (https://coenzymeQbiology.github.io/clinic-CoQ-deficiency ) about clinical manifestations of primary CoQ deficiency that will be periodically updated to incorporate new information published in the literature. Since CoQ primary deficiency is a rare disease, the available data are still limited, but as new patients are added over time, this tool could become a key resource for a more efficient diagnosis of this pathology.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nAbstractAim  The post‐glacial range dynamics of many European plant species have been widely investigated, but information rapidly diminishes as one moves further back in time. Here we infer the historical range shifts of Laurus, a paradigmatic tree of the Tethyan flora that has covered southern Eurasia since the Oligo‐Miocene, by means of phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses.Location  Mediterranean Basin, Black Sea and Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands).Methods  We analysed plastid DNA (cpDNA) sequence (trnK–matK, trnD–trnT) variation in 57 populations of Laurus and three Lauraceae genera. Phylogenetic methods (maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference) and statistical parsimony networks were used to reconstruct relationships among haplotypes. These results were contrasted with the fossil record and bioclimatic niche‐based model predictions of past distributions to infer the migration routes and location of refugia.Results  The phylogenetic tree revealed monophyly for Laurus. Overall sequence variability was low within Laurus, but six different haplotypes were distinguished and a single network retrieved, portraying three lineages primarily related to geography. A strongly divergent eastern lineage occupied Turkey and the Near East, a second clade was located in the Aegean region and, lastly, a western clade grouped all Macaronesian and central and western Mediterranean populations. A close relationship was observed between the Macaronesian populations of L. azorica and the western populations of L. nobilis.Main conclusions  The phylogeographical structure of Laurus preserves the imprints of an ancient contraction and break‐up of the range that resulted in the evolution of separate cpDNA lineages in its western‐ and easternmost extremes. Intense range dynamics in the western Mediterranean and multiple glacial refugia contributed to the generation and long‐term conservation of this phylogeographical pattern, as shown by the fit between the haplotype ranges and past suitable areas inferred from bioclimatic models. Finally, our results challenge the taxonomic separation of Laurus into two distinct species.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nAlthough climate change is expected to drive tree species toward colder and wetter regions of their distribution, broadscale empirical evidence is lacking. One possibility is that past and present human activities in forests obscure or alter the effects of climate. Here, using data from more than two million monitored trees from 73 widely distributed species, we quantify changes in tree species density within their climatic niches across Northern Hemisphere forests. We observe a reduction in mean density across species, coupled with a tendency toward increasing tree size. However, the direction and magnitude of changes in density exhibit considerable variability between species, influenced by stand development that results from previous stand-level disturbances. Remarkably, when accounting for stand development, our findings show a significant change in density toward cold and wet climatic conditions for 43% of the species, compared to only 14% of species significantly changing their density toward warm and arid conditions in both early- and late-development stands. The observed changes in climate-driven density showed no clear association with species traits related to drought tolerance, recruitment and dispersal capacity, or resource use, nor with the temperature or aridity affiliation of the species, leaving the underlying mechanism uncertain. Forest conservation policies and associated management strategies might want to consider anticipated long-term species range shifts alongside the integration of contemporary within-distribution density changes.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nLas poblaciones de ciervos y otros ungulados se han incrementado enormemente en muchas áreas mediterráneas en las últimas décadas. Los impactos del incremento de la presión de herbivoría en las comunidades de plantas y la eficacia de distintas medidas de conservación están aún poco claras. En este trabajo se evalúan los efectos de la herbivoría en comunidades arbustivas del Campo de Gibraltar y Parque Natural de Los Alcornocales. Se ha comparado la diversidad de plantas, la cobertura, la altura y la intensidad de daños dentro y fuera de un total de 20 cercados de exclusión de herbívoros establecidos hace 10-15 años para favorecer la regeneración del bosque. Aunque la composición de la comunidad de plantas (riqueza de especies y diversidad) fue similar en las zonas cercadas y no cercadas, la altura de los arbustos y su cobertura fueron mayores dentro de los cercados de protección. En contraste, el daño de herbivoría fue mucho mayor en las áreas no cercadas, particularmente en aquellas plantas de etapas sucesionales tardías y más palatables. Aunque la mayoría de las especies son de larga vida y muy resilientes, la sobrepoblación de herbívoros mantenida en el tiempo puede comprometer su reproducción y persistencia a largo plazo. De este modo, la sobrepoblación de ciervos está moldeando la estructura de las comunidades arbustivas mediterráneas, reduciendo su densidad y seleccionando aquellas plantas más tolerantes a la perturbación y el ramoneo frente a aquellas de etapas sucesionales más tardías.\nDeer have overpopulated many Mediterranean areas in recent decades. The likely impacts of the increased herbivory pressure on Mediterranean plant communities are, however, unclear. Here we assess the community-wide effects of deer browsing in shrublands of Los Alcornocales Natural Park (southern Spain). We compared plant species diversity, cover, height, and damage intensity within and outside of deer exclosures established 10-15 years ago to promote natural regeneration of the forest. Although community composition (species richness and diversity) was similar in fenced and non-fenced areas, shrub height and cover were higher within fenced areas. In contrast, browsing damage was much higher in open areas, particularly for late-successional, highly palatable species. Although most plant species were long-lived and highly resilient, sustained overbrowsing might compromise reproduction and long-term persistence in the landscape. Thus, deer overpopulation is shaping the structure of these Mediterranean shrublands, reducing shrub density and selecting against shade-tolerant species, hence delaying succession.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nHurricane winds can have large impacts on forest structure and dynamics. To date, most evaluations of hurricane impacts have focused on short‐term responses after a hurricane, often lacked pre‐hurricane measurements, and missed responses occurring over longer time scales. Here, we use a long‐term data set (1974–2009, 35 years) of tree stems (&gt;3 cm in diameter at 1.3 m aboveground) in four sites (0.35 ha in total) in montane rain forest (∼1600 m elevation) in Jamaica to investigate the patterns of crown damage in individual stems by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, and how subsequent growth and mortality were affected by hurricane damage, sprouting, and the incidence of multiple stems. Topographical position on a mountain ridge was the best predictor of crown damage, followed by crown size and species identity. The average diameter growth rate of stems that survived the hurricane was greater than that pre‐hurricane for the whole 21‐yr post‐hurricane period. Growth rates of stems with damaged crowns increased less than those with undamaged crowns; differences in growth rate between damaged and undamaged trees disappeared after 11 years. Hurricane‐damaged stems had two to eight times higher mortality than undamaged stems for 19 years post hurricane. Many stems sprouted shortly after the hurricane, but few sprouts managed to establish (grow to &gt;3 cm diameter at breast height). However, sprouting and multi‐stemming were associated with reduced mortality rate, particularly in damaged trees. From an initial population of 1670 stems in 1974, 54% were still alive in 2009 (21 years after the hurricane). We conclude that despite the high frequency of hurricane damage to tree crowns and the subsequent increased mortality rate in this hurricane‐prone tropical montane forest, many stems will be hit and recover from several hurricanes in their lifetime.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe S Iberian Peninsula and NW Africa constitute one of the main hotspots for plant biodiversity within the Mediterranean Basin. At the core of this hotspot, across the Strait of Gibraltar, lies a smaller region whose singular Cenozoic history and ecological features have created a distinct, nested sub-hotspot. In particular, an important relict flora, a high endemism, and the dominance of vegetation types other than the paradigmatic Mediterranean-type sclerophyllous forests and shrublands, are biogeographical features of paramount relevance. These singular environments may have provided suitable mesic habitats for stable human populations in this region throughout the Quaternary. Here we explore the possible causes of the unique biodiversity of this region. First, we show that endemism is associated with poor soils and mild Mediterranean climate, whereas relictness is primarily associated with riparian and humid habitats which might have remained relatively stable since the Late Tertiary. We then review and provide new results on lineage and molecular diversity of some taxa based on their evolutionary relationships inferred from phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses. These indicate that long-lived plants, such as trees, tend to show some discontinuity in effective gene flow, in comparison with short-lived and pioneer plants. Colonization abilities rather than dispersal vectors appear to be a crucial factor. We also analyze the role of microevolutionary processes that generate plant biodiversity in terms of reproductive features involved in lineage formation, such as breeding system, pollination biology and postdispersal regeneration. The few available studies show that this region is prone to changes in reproductive systems, associated with both abiotic and biotic conditions in the new habitats that plants face during colonization. Dispersal and regeneration ecology is especially important for relict species, as most of these species face some biotic (e.g., lack of dispersers, predation) and abiotic (edaphic and/or microclimate requirements) limitations to their recruitment. Nevertheless current limitations in the recruitment of relict plant species should not obscure the fact that they have been resilient in the face of Plio–Pleistocene climate changes in the Gibraltar region, whereas they became extinct in other Mediterranean areas. The relatively stable and mild climate of this region may have provided a suitable long-term environment for many other organisms, including humans.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nForest canopies buffer macroclimatic temperature fluctuations. However, we do not know if and how the capacity of canopies to buffer understorey temperature will change with accelerating climate change. Here we map the difference (offset) between temperatures inside and outside forests in the recent past and project these into the future in boreal, temperate and tropical forests. Using linear mixed-effect models, we combined a global database of 714 paired time series of temperatures (mean, minimum and maximum) measured inside forests vs. in nearby open habitats with maps of macroclimate, topography and forest cover to hindcast past (1970–2000) and to project future (2060–2080) temperature differences between free-air temperatures and sub-canopy microclimates. For all tested future climate scenarios, we project that the difference between maximum temperatures inside and outside forests across the globe will increase (i.e. result in stronger cooling in forests), on average during 2060–2080, by 0.27 ± 0.16 °C (RCP2.6) and 0.60 ± 0.14 °C (RCP8.5) due to macroclimate changes. This suggests that extremely hot temperatures under forest canopies will, on average, warm less than outside forests as macroclimate warms. This knowledge is of utmost importance as it suggests that forest microclimates will warm at a slower rate than non-forested areas, assuming that forest cover is maintained. Species adapted to colder growing conditions may thus find shelter and survive longer than anticipated at a given forest site. This highlights the potential role of forests as a whole as microrefugia for biodiversity under future climate change.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nMutualistic interactions among free-living species generally involve low-frequency interactions and highly asymmetric dependence among partners, yet our understanding of factors behind their emergence is still limited. Using individual-based interactions of a super-generalist fleshy-fruited plant with its frugivore assemblage, we estimated the Resource Provisioning Effectiveness (RPE) and Seed Dispersal Effectiveness (SDE) to assess the balance in the exchange of resources. Plants were highly dependent on a few frugivore species, while frugivores interacted with most individual plants, resulting in strong asymmetries of mutual dependence. Interaction effectiveness was mainly driven by interaction frequency. Despite highly asymmetric dependences, the strong reliance on quantity of fruit consumed determined high reciprocity in rewards between partners (i.e. higher energy provided by the plant, more seedlings recruited), which was not obscured by minor variations in the quality of animal or plant service. We anticipate reciprocity will emerge in low-intimacy mutualisms where the mutualistic outcome largely relies upon interaction frequency.\n\nPublication metrics"

Despite decades of investigation, our limited knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary effects of climate changes often translates into uncertain predictions about the impact of future climates on biodiversity. Integrative biogeographical approaches using palaeobotanical, phylogenetic and niche-based species distribution models, when permitted by data availability, may provide valuable insights to address these key questions. Here we combine palaeobotanical and phylogeographical information with hindcast modelling of species distribution changes to reconstruct past range dynamics and differentiation in the bay laurel (Laurus spp., Lauraceae), an emblematic relict tree from the subtropical laurel forests that thrived in Tethyan realms during most of the Tertiary period. We provide plausible examples of climate-driven migration, extinction and persistence of populations and taxa, and discuss the factors that influence niche conservatism or adaptation to changing environments. Finally, we discuss the likely impacts of the predicted climate change on laurophyllous taxa in the Mediterranean and Macaronesia.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nMale and female European Robins Erithacus rubecula display their red breasts in year‐round territorial contests. Despite the clear signalling role of the red breast, little is known about its sexual dimorphism or trends in size when Robins age. We studied these patterns in resident and migrant Robins in a Mediterranean population. Both male and female first‐year Robins had smaller red breasts than second‐year individuals. Females, but not males, showed a reduction in badge area after the second year of life, leading to sexual dimorphism in red breast area in the oldest Robins. The grey fringe around the red breast showed a steady increase in width in males when ageing, but not in females, also leading to sexual dimorphism in this trait among oldest Robins. The contrast between the red breast and its surrounding grey fringe was higher than that between the breast and the back at both high and low environmental light intensities. This suggests that the grey fringe could function as a frame to highlight the perimeter of the red breast, and that the Robin’s plumage is equally suited to display in open areas and forest understoreys. Our study suggests that the extent of the red breast and its grey frame could confer information about the age and sex of the birds, and thus be used as a signal in territorial contests and mating decisions.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nIn addition to well-known effects on species ecophysiology, phenology, and distributions, climate change is widely predicted to impact essential ecosystem services such as decomposition and nutrient cycling. While temperature and soil moisture are thought to influence litter decomposition, elucidating consistent soil process responses to observed or predicted shifts in climate have proven difficult to evidence. Here we investigated how aspect (i.e., north-south orientation), a natural model for variation in soil temperature, influenced soil physico-chemical conditions and decomposition of two standardised litter types (Green tea and Rooibos teabags) in Pole-facing (PF) and Equator-facing (EF) roadside verges spanning a 3000 km and 27° latitudinal gradient across Europe. Despite average daily temperatures being 1.5 - 3.0 °C warmer on EF than PF slopes, there were only minor region-specific differences in initial soil physico-chemical conditions and short-term variation in litter decomposition (i.e., litter mass loss was higher in EF-verges for the first month of deployment only) associated with aspect. We conclude that previously observed differences in soil environments and the decomposition process associated with slope orientation, is largely litter or environment specific, although medium-term soil-decomposition in semi-natural grassland ecosystems may also be insensitive to the magnitude of temperature variation within the range predicted by the IPCC SSP1–2.6 emissions scenario. Nonetheless, consistent average and extreme temperature differences between adjacent PF- and EF-aspects along roadside verges provides a model system to explore exactly how resilient the soil environment and the micro-organisms responsible for decomposition, are to temperature variation.\n\nPublication metrics\n\n\n\n”"

We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life‐history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (R:S) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species.\nIntraspecific leaf N:P ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural populations. Conversely, the plant height decreased and SLA increased significantly with latitude of population origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental drivers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal.\nSynthesis. Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set‐up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life‐history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and confounding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, integrated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.  \n\nPublication metrics"

We show that forests function as a thermal insulator, cooling the understory when ambient temperatures are hot and warming the understory when ambient temperatures are cold. The understory versus open temperature offset is magnified as temperatures become more extreme and is of greater magnitude than the warming of land temperatures over the past century. Tree canopies may thus reduce the severity of warming impacts on forest biodiversity and functioning.\n\nPublication metrics"

However, quantitative data are limited; often, only expert-based qualitative estimates are available. With the ClimPlant database, we capitalize on the link between species distribution ranges and macroclimate to infer the realized climatic niches of 968 European forest plant species.\nMain types of variables contained\nThe ClimPlant database contains information on the distribution of monthly, growing-season and annual mean, minimum and maximum temperature and total precipitation within the distribution range of 968 European forest plants.\nSpatial location and grain\nEurope in 10 arc-min grid cells; the study area has been cropped rectangularly at 15° W (Atlantic Ocean), 60° E (Ural Mountains), 25° N (Sahara) and 75° N (Arctic Ocean).\nTime period and grain\nThe distribution ranges of forest plant species are based on two renowned distribution atlases. The monthly mean, minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation between 1970 and 2000 were extracted from WorldClim v.2.\nMajor taxa and level of measurement\nNine hundred and sixty-eight vascular plant species of European forests, with taxonomy following the Euro+Med PlantBase nomenclature .\nSoftware format\nData in 56 CSV files, with 1,000 values for monthly, growing season and annual observations of mean, minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation in the distribution range for every species.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe benefits of masting (volatile, quasi-synchronous seed production at lagged intervals) include satiation of seed predators, but these benefits come with a cost to mutualist pollen and seed dispersers. If the evolution of masting represents a balance between these benefits and costs, we expect mast avoidance in species that are heavily reliant on mutualist dispersers. These effects play out in the context of variable climate and site fertility among species that vary widely in nutrient demand. Meta-analyses of published data have focused on variation at the population scale, thus omitting periodicity within trees and synchronicity between trees. From raw data on 12 million tree-years worldwide, we quantified three components of masting that have not previously been analysed together: (i) volatility, defined as the frequency-weighted year-to-year variation; (ii) periodicity, representing the lag between high-seed years; and (iii) synchronicity, indicating the tree-to-tree correlation. Results show that mast avoidance (low volatility and low synchronicity) by species dependent on mutualist dispersers explains more variation than any other effect. Nutrient-demanding species have low volatility, and species that are most common on nutrient-rich and warm/wet sites exhibit short periods. The prevalence of masting in cold/dry sites coincides with climatic conditions where dependence on vertebrate dispersers is less common than in the wet tropics. Mutualist dispersers neutralize the benefits of masting for predator satiation, further balancing the effects of climate, site fertility and nutrient demands.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationships that control seed production in trees are fundamental to understanding the evolution of forest species and their capacity to recover from increasing losses to drought, fire, and harvest. A synthesis of fecundity data from 714 species worldwide allowed us to examine hypotheses that are central to quantifying reproduction, a foundation for assessing fitness in forest trees. Four major findings emerged. First, seed production is not constrained by a strict trade-off between seed size and numbers. Instead, seed numbers vary over ten orders of magnitude, with species that invest in large seeds producing more seeds than expected from the 1:1 trade-off. Second, gymnosperms have lower seed production than angiosperms, potentially due to their extra investments in protective woody cones. Third, nutrient-demanding species, indicated by high foliar phosphorus concentrations, have low seed production. Finally, sensitivity of individual species to soil fertility varies widely, limiting the response of community seed production to fertility gradients. In combination, these findings can inform models of forest response that need to incorporate reproductive potential.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nAre we entering a new ‘Golden Age’ of biogeography, with continued development of infrastructure and ideas? We highlight recent developments, and the challenges and opportunities they bring, in light of the snapshot provided by the 7th biennial meeting of the International Biogeography Society (IBS 2015). We summarize themes in and across 15 symposia using narrative analysis and word clouds, which we complement with recent publication trends and ‘research fronts’. We find that biogeography is still strongly defined by core sub-disciplines that reflect its origins in botanical, zoological (particularly bird and mammal), and geographic (e.g., island, montane) studies of the 1800s. That core is being enriched by large datasets (e.g. of environmental variables, ‘omics’, species’ occurrences, traits) and new techniques (e.g., advances in genetics, remote sensing, modeling) that promote studies with increasing detail and at increasing scales; disciplinary breadth is being diversified (e.g., by developments in paleobiogeography and microbiology) and integrated through the transfer of approaches and sharing of theory (e.g., spatial modeling and phylogenetics in evolutionary–ecological contexts). Yet some subdisciplines remain on the fringe (e.g., marine biogeography, deep-time paleobiogeography), new horizons and new theory may be overshadowed by popular techniques (e.g., species distribution modelling), and hypotheses, data, and analyses may each be wanting. Trends in publication suggest a shift away from traditional biogeography journals to multidisciplinary or open access journals. Thus, there are currently many opportunities and challenges as biogeography increasingly addresses human impacts on, and stewardship of, the planet (e.g., Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). As in the past, biogeographers doubtless will continue to be engaged by new data and methods in exploring the nexus between biology and geography for decades into the future. But golden ages come and go, and they need not touch every domain in a discipline nor affect subdisciplines at the same time; moreover, what appears to be a Golden Age may sometimes have an undesirable ‘Midas touch’. Contexts within and outwith biogeography—e.g., methods, knowledge, climate, biodiversity, politics—are continually changing, and at times it can be challenging to establish or maintain relevance. In so many races with the Red Queen, we suggest that biogeography will enjoy greatest success if we also increasingly engage with the epistemology of our discipline.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nIn recent decades there has been an increasing demand in environmental sciences for harmonized climatic data at large spatial scales and long periods. Here we present easyclimate, a software package to obtain daily climatic data at high resolution (0.0083°, ∼1 km) with R. The package facilitates the downloading and processing of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures for Europe from 1950 to 2020. Using easyclimate and given a set of coordinates (points or polygons) and dates (days or years), the user can download the climatic information as a tidy table or a raster object. In this package we implemented Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs which provide access to daily climate data for thousands of sites/days, without having to download huge rasters. Daily climate data are not available in many of the current climate databases and are essential for many research questions and applications in environmental modelling, forestry, and ecological and vegetation studies across Europe.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nSummary \nPriority question exercises are becoming an increasingly common tool to frame future agendas in conservation and ecological science. They are an effective way to identify research foci that advance the field and that also have high policy and conservation relevance.\nTo date, there has been no coherent synthesis of key questions and priority research areas for palaeoecology, which combines biological, geochemical and molecular techniques in order to reconstruct past ecological and environmental systems on time‐scales from decades to millions of years.\nWe adapted a well‐established methodology to identify 50 priority research questions in palaeoecology. Using a set of criteria designed to identify realistic and achievable research goals, we selected questions from a pool submitted by the international palaeoecology research community and relevant policy practitioners.\nThe integration of online participation, both before and during the workshop, increased international engagement in question selection.\nThe questions selected are structured around six themes: human–environment interactions in the Anthropocene; biodiversity, conservation and novel ecosystems; biodiversity over long time‐scales; ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycling; comparing, combining and synthesizing information from multiple records; and new developments in palaeoecology.\nFuture opportunities in palaeoecology are related to improved incorporation of uncertainty into reconstructions, an enhanced understanding of ecological and evolutionary dynamics and processes and the continued application of long‐term data for better‐informed landscape management.\nSynthesis. Palaeoecology is a vibrant and thriving discipline, and these 50 priority questions highlight its potential for addressing both pure (e.g. ecological and evolutionary, methodological) and applied (e.g. environmental and conservation) issues related to ecological science and global change.  \n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nAim  Climate changes are thought to be responsible for the retreat and eventual extinction of subtropical lauroid species that covered much of Europe and North Africa during the Palaeogene and early Neogene; little is known, however, of the spatial and temporal patterns of this demise. Herein we calibrate ecological niche models to assess the climatic requirements of Laurus L. (Lauraceae), an emblematic relic from the Tethyan subtropical flora, subsequently using these models to infer how the range dynamics of Laurus were affected by Plio-Pleistocene climate changes. We also provide predictions of likely range changes resulting from future climatic scenarios.\nLocation  The Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands (Canaries, Madeira, Azores).\nMethods  We used a maximum-entropy algorithm (Maxent) to model the relationship between climate and Laurus distribution over time. The models were fitted both to the present and to the middle Pliocene, based on fossil records. We employed climatic reconstructions for the mid-Pliocene (3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and a CO2-doubling future scenario to project putative species distribution in each period. We validated the model projections with Laurus fossil and present occurrences.\nResults  Laurus preferentially occupied warm and moist areas with low seasonality, showing a marked stasis of its climatic niche. Models fitted to Pliocene conditions successfully predicted the current species distribution. Large suitable areas existed during the Pliocene, which were strongly reduced during the Pleistocene, but humid refugia within the Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands enabled long-term persistence. Future climate conditions are likely to re-open areas suitable for colonization north of the current range.\nMain conclusions  The climatic requirements of Laurus remained virtually unchanged over the last 3 Myr. This marked niche conservatism imposed largely deterministic range dynamics driven by climate conditions. This species’s relatively high drought tolerance might account for the survival of Laurus in continental Europe throughout the Quaternary whilst other Lauraceae became extinct. Climatic scenarios for the end of this century would favour an expansion of the species’s range towards northern latitudes, while severely limiting southern populations due to increased water stress.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nHow individual species and entire ecosystems will respond to future climate change are among the most pressing questions facing ecologists. Past biodiversity dynamics recorded in the paleoecological archives show a broad array of responses, yet significant knowledge gaps remain. In particular, the relative roles of evolutionary adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and dispersal in promoting survival during times of climate change have yet to be clarified. Investigating the paleo-archives offers great opportunities to understand biodiversity responses to future climate change. In this review we discuss the mechanisms by which biodiversity responds to environmental change, and identify gaps of knowledge on the role of range shifts and tolerance. We also outline approaches at the intersection of paleoecology, genomics, experiments, and predictive models that will elucidate the processes by which species have survived past climatic changes and enhance predictions of future changes in biological diversity.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nClimate change is commonly assumed to induce species’ range shifts toward the poles. Yet, other environmental changes may affect the geographical distribution of species in unexpected ways. Here, we quantify multidecadal shifts in the distribution of European forest plants and link these shifts to key drivers of forest biodiversity change: climate change, atmospheric deposition (nitrogen and sulfur), and forest canopy dynamics. Surprisingly, westward distribution shifts were 2.6 times more likely than northward ones. Not climate change, but nitrogen-mediated colonization events, possibly facilitated by the recovery from past acidifying deposition, best explain westward movements. Biodiversity redistribution patterns appear complex and are more likely driven by the interplay among several environmental changes than due to the exclusive effects of climate change alone.\n\nPublication metrics"

Given the tetraploidy of the sampled populations, we analyzed our data both as dominant loci and as codominant genotypic data to calculate allele frequencies and genetic diversity. A total of 196 and 222 alleles were found in 37 Mediterranean (L. nobilis) and 26 Macaronesian islands (L. azorica) individuals, respectively.• Conclusions: Levels of polymorphism of the reported markers are adequate for studies of diversity and parentage in natural populations of this Tertiary relict tree.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "title": "Lasting effects of avian-frugivore interactions on seed dispersal and seedling establishment",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nThe consequences of plant–animal interactions often transcend the mere encounter stage, as those encounters are followed by a chain of subsequent stages on the plant’s reproductive cycle that ultimately determine fitness. Yet, the dissemination and recruitment stages of animal-mediated seed dispersal are seldom analysed jointly, hindering a full understanding of the ecology of seed dispersal.\nWe analyse the dispersal and recruitment of a fleshy-fruited plant (Pistacia lentiscus), from fruit production to seedling survival up to their second year. We link early reproductive investment of individual plants to seedling recruitment and explore the role played by seed viability, the coterie of frugivores and microhabitat seed deposition.\nThe proportion of viable seeds was generally low (mean = 34%) but highly variable among individual plants (range: 0%–95%). Seed viability did not seem to have a direct effect on individual plant’s recruitment.\nWe recorded 28 bird species feeding on P. lentiscus fruits or seeds. Their contribution to plant recruitment was mainly determined by their intensity of fruit consumption and probability to disperse viable seeds. Most frugivores presented non-random microhabitat preferences, delivering uneven seed contributions to different sites.\nPost-dispersal seed predation by rodents was the most limiting phase in P. lentiscus recruitment. Yet, microhabitats showing the lowest predation rates received the lowest seed rain. Hence, we found a decoupling of the dissemination and recruitment stages: most seeds do not arrive at the most suitable microhabitats.\nWe estimate P. lentiscus plants need to produce c. 5 × 105 fruits to recruit a single seedling that survives to its second summer in our study site. Its success as a prevalent species in Mediterranean lowland landscapes relies on its high fecundity and thorough fruit removal and dispersal by a diversified frugivore assemblage, which compensates for the high seed unviability characteristic of this genus.\nSynthesis: Measuring the delayed, post-dispersal outcomes of animal frugivory interactions may overturn inferences based on consumption observations only. Seed rain patterns are often decoupled from microhabitats’ suitability for seedling recruitment. Hence, more integrative studies that encompass the entire plant reproductive cycle (from fruit production to seedling recruitment) are needed to fully understand frugivores’ lasting contribution to plant regeneration in natural populations.\n\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nAim\nRange shifts are expected to occur when populations at one range margin perform better than those at the other margin, yet no global trend in population performances at range margins has been demonstrated empirically across a wide range of taxa and biomes. Here we test the prediction that, if impacts of ongoing climate change on performance in marginal populations are widespread, then populations from the high-latitude margin (HLM) should perform as well as or better than central populations, whereas low-latitude margin (LLM) populations should perform worse. Location\nGlobal. Time period\n1995–2019. Major taxa studied\nPlants and animals. Methods\nTo test our prediction, we used a meta-analysis to quantify empirical support for asymmetry in the performance of high- and low-latitude margin populations compared to central populations. Performance estimates (survival, reproduction, or lifetime fitness) for populations occurring in their natural environment were derived from 51 papers involving 113 margin-centre comparisons from 54 species and 705 populations from the Americas, Europe, Africa and Australia. We then related these performance differences to climatic differences among populations. We also tested whether patterns are consistent across taxonomic kingdoms (plants vs animals) and across realms (marine vs terrestrial). Results\nPopulations at margins performed significantly worse than central populations, and this trend was primarily driven by the low-latitude margin. Although the difference was of small magnitude, it was largely consistent across biological kingdoms and realms. Differences in performance were weakly (p = .08) related to the difference in average temperatures between central and marginal populations. Main conclusions\nThe observed asymmetry in performance in marginal populations is consistent with predictions about the effects of global climate change, though further research is needed to confirm the effect of climate. It indicates that changes in demographic rates in marginal populations can serve as early-warning signals of impending range shifts.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nClimate refugia, locations where taxa survive periods of regionally adverse climate, are thought to be critical for maintaining biodiversity through the glacial–interglacial climate changes of the Quaternary. A critical research need is to better integrate and reconcile the three major lines of evidence used to infer the existence of past refugia – fossil records, species distribution models and phylogeographic surveys – in order to characterize the complex spatiotemporal trajectories of species and populations in and out of refugia. Here we review the complementary strengths, limitations and new advances for these three approaches. We provide case studies to illustrate their combined application, and point the way towards new opportunities for synthesizing these disparate lines of evidence. Case studies with European beech, Qinghai spruce and Douglas-fir illustrate how the combination of these three approaches successfully resolves complex species histories not attainable from any one approach. Promising new statistical techniques can capitalize on the strengths of each method and provide a robust quantitative reconstruction of species history. Studying past refugia can help identify contemporary refugia and clarify their conservation significance, in particular by elucidating the fine-scale processes and the particular geographic locations that buffer species against rapidly changing climate.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nAbstractEstimating species ability to adapt to environmental changes is crucial to understand their past and future response to climate change. The Mediterranean Basin has experienced remarkable climatic changes since the Miocene, which have greatly influenced the evolution of the Mediterranean flora. Here, we examine the evolutionary history and biogeographic patterns of two sedge sister species (Carex, Cyperaceae) restricted to the western Mediterranean Basin, but with Pliocene fossil record in central Europe. In particular, we estimated the evolution of climatic niches through time and its influence in lineage differentiation. We carried out a dated phylogenetic–phylogeographic study based on seven DNA regions (nDNA and ptDNA) and fingerprinting data (AFLPs), and modelled ecological niches and species distributions for the Pliocene, Pleistocene and present. Phylogenetic and divergence time analyses revealed that both species form a monophyletic lineage originated in the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene. We detected clear genetic differentiation between both species with distinct genetic clusters in disjunct areas, indicating the predominant role of geographic barriers limiting gene flow. We found a remarkable shift in the climatic requirements between Pliocene and extant populations, although the niche seems to have been relatively conserved since the Pleistocene split of both species. This study highlights how an integrative approach combining different data sources and analyses, including fossils, allows solid and robust inferences about the evolutionary history of a plant group since the Pliocene.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSpecies-level networks emerge as the combination of interactions spanning multiple individuals, and their study has received considerable attention over the past 30 y. However, less is known about the structure of interaction configurations within species, even though individuals are the actual interacting units in nature. We compiled 46 empirical, individual-based, interaction networks on plant-animal seed dispersal mutualisms, comprising 1,037 plant individuals across 29 species from various regions. We compared the structure of individual-based networks to that of species-based networks and, by extending the niche concept to interaction assemblages, we explored individual plant specialization. Using a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty derived from sampling, we examined how plant individuals “explore” the interaction niche of their populations. Both individual-based and species-based networks exhibited high variability in network properties, lacking remarkable structural and topological differences between them. Within populations, frugivores’ interaction allocation among plant individuals was highly heterogeneous, with one to three frugivore species dominating interactions. Regardless of species or bioregion, plant individuals displayed a variety of interaction profiles across populations, with a consistently-small percentage of individuals playing a central role and exhibiting high diversity in their interaction assemblage. Plant populations showed variable mid to low levels of niche specialization; and individuals’ interaction niche “breadth” accounted for 70% of the population interaction diversity, on average. Our results highlight how downscaling from species to individual-based networks helps understanding the structuring of interactions within ecological communities and provide an empirical basis for the extension of niche theory to complex mutualistic networks.\n\nSignificance Statement\nEcological interactions in nature occur between individual partners rather than species, and their outcomes determine fitness variation. By examining among-individual variation in interaction niches, we can bridge evolutionary and ecological perspectives to understand interaction biodiversity. This study investigates individual plant variation in frugivore assemblages worldwide, exploring how plant individuals “build” their interaction profiles with animal frugivores. The structure of networks composed of individuals was surprisingly similar to networks composed of species. Within populations, only a few plants played a key role in attracting a high diversity of frugivores, making them central to the overall network structure. Individuals actually interacted with a substantial diversity of partners, with individual niche “breadth” accounting for up to 70% of total interaction diversity, on average.\n\n\nPublication metrics"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe forests in the Iberian Peninsula have been strongly influenced by past climatic changes, but reconstructing their historical distributions and dynamics is very difficult due to the complex climatic characteristics and relief of the region. Research disciplines such as phylogeography and species distribution modelling can describe the past range dynamics of individual tree species in relatively great detail and help elucidate how these species have reacted to climatic changes. Here we review phylogeographical and modelling studies from species representative of the major Iberian forest types and attempt to extract general trends from the diversity of individual species histories in the Peninsula. To date most studies focus on geographical range dynamics during the Pleistocene, but an increasing body of evidence shows that some species have also retained the genetic imprints of much more ancient processes. Many widespread Iberian species show a deep and often remarkably clear-cut divide between populations from the Mediterranean and from the Atlantic regions of the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting that both areas have independently sustained viable populations over extended periods. In fact, phylogeographical studies commonly find that species had several glacial refugia across the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, distribution models help identifying further suitable areas that could have sustained so far undetected refugia. Such studies are of interest for species conservation, because refugium populations are high-priority targets due to their long-term persistence and unique evolutionary trajectory. Overall, we conclude that palaeoecology, phylogeography and species distribution modelling have a great potential to inform each other because of their complementary perspectives and results. A true integration of these approaches is therefore fundamental for further progress in our understanding of past Iberian environments and the organisms they harboured.\n\nPublication metrics"

We challenge the default practice of modeling at the species level, which ignores the process of niche evolution and erroneously assumes that the species is always the appropriate level for niche estimation.

A global synthesis of raw seedproduction data shows a 250‐fold increase in seed abundance from cold‐dry to warm‐wet climates, driven primarily by a 100‐fold increase in seed production for a given tree size. The modest (threefold) increase in forest productivity across the same climate gradient cannot explain the magnitudes of these trends. The increase in seeds per tree can arise from adaptive evolution driven by intense species interactions or from the direct effects of a warm, moist climate on tree fecundity.

We investigated climatic niche differences of five Carex bipolar species in North and South America to assess niche shifts between these two regions. Moreover, we assessed potential distribution changes with future climate change.METHODS:We used 1202 presence data points from herbarium specimens and 19 bioclimatic variables to assess climatic niche differences and potential distributions among the five species using ordination methods and Maxent.KEY RESULTS:The niche overlap analyses showed low levels of niche filling and high climatic niche expansion between North and South America. Carex macloviana and C. maritima showed the greatest niche expansion (60% and 96%, respectively), followed by C. magellanica (45%) and C. microglochin (39%). Only C. canescens did not colonize new environments (niche expansion = 0.2%). In contrast, all species but C. magellanica had niche filling that was &lt;40%; hence, they are absent in the south from many environments they inhabit in North America. Climate change will push all species toward higher latitudes and elevation, reducing the availability of suitable environments.CONCLUSIONS:The colonization of South America seems to have involved frequent climatic niche shifts. Most species have colonized new environments from those occupied in the North. Observed niche shifts appear congruent with time since colonization and with current genetic structure within species. In these cold‐dwelling species, climate change will most likely decrease their suitable environments in the future.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nEcological interactions are a key component of biodiversity, essential for understanding ecosystem services and functioning. Recording and quantifying ecological interactions is challenging, frequently requiring complex logistics and substantial effort in the field. Camera traps are routinely used in ecology for various applications, and have proven to be an excellent method for passive and non-invasive sampling of plant–animal interactions. We implemented a standardized camera trap protocol to document vertebrate frugivores-fleshy fruited plants interactions in Doñana National Park, SW Spain, with the central objective of inventorying the diversity of plant–animal ecological interactions providing seed dispersal services. From 2018 to 2023 we recorded pairwise interactions from which we obtained qualitative (presence-absence) and quantitative (frequency of visits) information. Each record in the dataset contains information of a visit by an individual animal to an individual plant, resulting in any form of fleshy-fruit use and provides information on visitation phenology, visit length, and feeding behavior. The dataset presented here includes 10,659 frugivory interaction events for 59 vertebrate species (46 birds, 13 mammals) recorded on 339 plant individuals from 13 different plant species which dominate the fleshy-fruited plant assemblage in the Doñana National Park. The most recorded animal species consuming fruits and playing a legitimate seed dispersal role was Curruca melanocephala (1678 records) among birds and Vulpes vulpes among mammals (751 records). Cervus elaphus, a fruit consumer with a marginal role as legitimate seed disperser, was the most recorded mammal species (1508 records). Avian frugivores, particularly those from the Sylviidae and Turdidae families, are widespread in the region and play a crucial role in maintaining the dispersal service for the fleshy-fruited plant populations in the area. The dataset offers highly versatile quantitative information that can be used to investigate frugivory from the highest resolution scale, the interaction event between pairs of individuals. In addition, other information that can be extracted includes the timing of interactions of animals and plants (their phenological couplings), activity periods of the animals, behavior during the events and preferences for individual plants within populations. There are no copyright restrictions on the data. When using the data from this data paper in publications, we kindly request that you cite the paper accordingly. Additionally, we encourage researchers and educators to inform us about how they are using this data, as we value feedback and would like to be aware of its various applications.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nCompetition for light has profound effects on plant performance in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems. Nowhere is this more evident than in forests, where trees create environmental heterogeneity that shapes the dynamics of forest-floor communities1–3. Observational evidence suggests that biotic responses to both anthropogenic global warming and nitrogen pollution may be attenuated by the shading effects of trees and shrubs4–9. Here we show experimentally that tree shade is slowing down changes in below-canopy communities due to warming. We manipulated levels of photosynthetically active radiation, temperature and nitrogen, alone and in combination, in a temperate forest understorey over a 3-year period, and monitored the composition of the understorey community. Light addition, but not nitrogen enrichment, accelerated directional plant community responses to warming, increasing the dominance of warmth-preferring taxa over cold-tolerant plants (a process described as thermophilization6,10–12). Tall, competitive plants took greatest advantage of the combination of elevated temperature and light. Warming of the forest floor did not result in strong community thermophilization unless light was also increased. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of locally closed canopy conditions could reduce, at least temporarily, warming-induced changes in forest floor plant communities.\n\nPublication metrics"

    "text": "Abstract\nLa inmensa mayoría de los estudios científicos no son reproducibles: resulta muy difícil, si no imposible, trazar todo el proceso de análisis y obtención de resultados a partir de un conjunto de datos – incluso tratándose de los mismos investigadores. La trazabilidad y reproducibilidad de los resultados son sin embargo condiciones inherentes a la ciencia de calidad, y un requisito cada vez más frecuente por parte de revistas y organismos financiadores de la investigación. Los estudios científicos reproducibles incluyen código informático capaz de recrear todos los resultados a partir de los datos originales. De esta manera el proceso de análisis queda perfectamente registrado, se reduce drásticamente el riesgo de errores, y se facilita la reutilización de código para otros análisis. Pero la ciencia reproducible no sólo acelera el progreso científico sino que también reporta múltiples beneficios para el investigador como el ahorro de tiempo y esfuerzo, o el incremento de la calidad e impacto de sus publicaciones. En este artículo explicamos en qué consiste la reproducibilidad, por qué es necesaria en ciencia, y cómo podemos hacer ciencia reproducible. Presentamos una serie de recomendaciones y herramientas para el manejo y análisis de datos, control de versiones de archivos, organización de ficheros y manejo de programas informáticos que nos permiten desarrollar flujos de trabajo reproducibles en el contexto actual de la ecología.\n\nPublication metrics"

We believe we do better science if we feel balanced and fulfilled in our lives. Happy labs are better labs. We may have families, hobbies, plans outside of the lab. Whenever permitted, we are flexible with working hours and schedules. We rest and take holidays when needed. We celebrate good news and are empathetic to life events. We accept honest failures and take them as learning opportunities. We support each other. We treat each other with respect, empathy and friendliness. In the end, we aim to be friends/colleagues who enjoy doing science together.\nGuiding principles. Our lab motto is “We need less research, better research, and research done for the right reasons” (Altman 1994). We don’t want to do research just for the sake of publishing. Our goal is to do research that helps advance our understanding of the world and ideally also contribute to make it a better place. In the process we expect to learn new things, satisfy our curiosity, produce useful results and enjoy the process. We do not compete with anyone but ourselves to do sound research, the best research we can given our circumstances and limitations. We always keep learning and improving.\nReproducibility and open science. We believe open and reproducible science is better science, in general. We believe in the power of collaboration and team work. To the extent possible, we use preprints, share data and code with all our research papers. We pay a lot of attention and effort to curate and check our data and analysis workflows, and do our best to ensure our results are reproducible, robust and rigorous. We care a lot about uncertainty (hence the name of MAYBE_lab ;-)."
